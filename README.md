Most filenames should be self explanitory.

Sweep and clock_gui were testing sketches to produce working code that would later be merged with the full project.
This was done to save time during compilation and flashing.

project key shows what all the buttons on the TM1638 do.
refrences shows places and people I have learnt from regarding some topics included in the project.
I believe all of the code has been modified to a degree where they count as my own work.
